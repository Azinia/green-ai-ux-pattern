# Green AI UX Pattern – Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1: Vision

**Let’s make AI not just smart—but aware.**  
We’re building a simple UX pattern and API that empowers AI users to make energy-conscious decisions before running compute-heavy tasks.

---

## Slide 2: Problem

AI tools today consume massive amounts of compute and energy – invisibly.  
Users have no idea how much power they burn when generating images or running models.  
This leads to:
- Wasteful compute
- High cloud costs
- Hidden environmental impact

---

## Slide 3: Solution

A resource usage preview for AI tasks:
- Shows GPU time, energy (kWh), CO₂ emissions
- Offers [Proceed] / [Eco Mode] / [Cancel]
- Easy to integrate via API or UI SDK

---

## Slide 4: Market Opportunity

- 100M+ daily generative AI queries
- $100B+ cloud & AI tooling industry
- ESG & AI regulation momentum is growing
- First-mover advantage in **Green UX for AI**

---

## Slide 5: Business Model

**Revenue Streams:**
- Developer API (freemium + paid tiers)
- UX SDK licensing for AI platforms
- Digital toolkit/playbook sales
- Custom consulting for responsible AI UX

---

## Slide 6: Traction Plan

- Open-source release on GitHub
- Share in AI communities (LinkedIn, X, Hugging Face)
- Build partnerships with open-source platforms
- Launch paid API + toolkit

---

## Slide 7: Impact

**Scenario:**
- 1M AI image generations/day
- Avg. energy use per task: 0.01149 kWh
- 30% users choose Eco Mode (40% less energy)

**Results:**
- 300,000 tasks/day × 0.004596 kWh saved = 1,379 kWh/day
- **~41,370 kWh saved per month**
- **~210 metric tons of CO₂ saved per year**
  (based on 0.417 kg CO₂ per kWh)

**Equivalent to:**
- Removing 45+ cars from the road/year
- Powering 150 homes for a month
- Saving over 500,000 smartphone charges

---

## Slide 8: Ask

Looking for:
- Partners to pilot API integration
- Advisors in AI ethics + climate tech
- Early adopters, contributors, and backers

Let's build the future of sustainable AI, together.
